This limitation can restrict developers when they need to customize form validation behaviors and ensure that error messages are displayed under specific conditions—regardless of the default validation flow. By exposing a forceErrorText parameter in the widget's constructor, developers will gain finer control over the error display, which is especially useful in complex forms requiring custom validation logic.\n\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nIntroduce a new forceErrorText parameter in the DropdownButtonFormField constructor. This parameter should be forwarded to the FormField superclass by calling super.forceErrorText during initialization. This enhancement will enable developers to explicitly control when error messages are rendered, thereby improving the flexibility and usability of form validations in Flutter applications while maintaining backward compatibility with existing implementations.",

When TalkBack/Screenreader is enabled and you 'tap' on the PopupMenuItem, the handleTap is executed, which leads to navigation to the previous page. This does not happen without TalkBack/screenreader, which executes the OnTap within the PopupMenuItem.\n\n### Expected results\n\nWhile using TalkBack/Screenreader, tapping on the PopupMenuItem should execute the OnTap function.\n\n### Actual results\n\nWhile using TalkBack/Screenreader, tapping on the PopupMenuItem leads to the previous page.\n\n### Code sample\n\n<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>\n\n```dart\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return BlocConsumer<FilePickerCubit, FilePickerState>(\n        bloc: _cubit,\n        listener: _listen,\n        builder: (BuildContext context, FilePickerState state) {\n          if (state is FilePickerReadyState) {\n            return PopupMenuItem<dynamic>(\n              child: Semantics(\n                label: widget.errorText,\n                child: ActionTile(\n                  title: _localization.fileSourceNewPhoto,\n                  onTap: () {\n                    _cubit.pickFromCamera(showTips: widget.showCameraTips);\n                  },\n                ),\n              ),\n            );\n          }\n        });\n  }\n\n```\nIn PopupMenuEntry:\n```dart\n\n@protected\nvoid handleTap() {\n  // Need to pop the navigator first in case onTap may push new route onto navigator.\n  Navigator.pop<T>(context, widget.value);\n\n  widget.onTap?.call();\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Screenshots or Video\n\n<details open>\n<summary>Screenshots / Video demonstration</summary>\n\n[Upload media here]\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Logs\n\n<details open><summary>Logs</summary>\n\n```console\n[Paste your logs here]\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Flutter Doctor output\n\n<details open><summary>Doctor output</summary>\n\n```console\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.27.4, on macOS 13.7.1 22H221 darwin-x64, locale en-NL)\n    • Flutter version 3.27.4 on channel stable at /Users/yiou/development/flutter\n    • Upstream repository https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git\n    • Framework revision d8a9f9a52e (6 weeks ago), 2025-01-31 16:07:18 -0500\n    • Engine revision 82bd5b7209\n    • Dart version 3.6.2\n    • DevTools version 2.40.3\n\n[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 35.0.0)\n    • Android SDK at /Users/yiou/Library/Android/sdk\n    • Platform android-35, build-tools 35.0.0\n    • ANDROID_HOME = /Users/yiou/Library/Android/sdk\n    • ANDROID_SDK_ROOT = /Users/yiou/Library/Android/sdk\n    • Java binary at: /Users/yiou/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jbr-17.0.12/Contents/Home/bin/java\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment JBR-17.0.12+1-1207.37-nomod (build 17.0.12+1-b1207.37)\n    !

For comparison, you can also launch the same project on macOS, where no bug seems to be present.\n2. By default, three containers are visible (`simple.frag`, `texture.frag`, `texture.frag` using AnimatedSampler from `flutter_shaders`). The result should be three proper gradients\n3. Click on the \"1\" on the bottom to disable the first container. This will result in the other two containers somehow changing their UVs.\n\n### Expected results\n\nThe other containers should not be affected by the first container.\n\n### Actual results\n\nThe other containers seem to not be binding their uniforms - if I set the fragment color to `vec4(u_size, 0.0, 1.0)`, then the color is black. Somehow this is not present when there's no `sampler2D`. \n\nOn macOS everything seems to work well.\n\n### Code sample\n\nhttps://github.com/kekland/fragment_shader_bug\n\n### Screenshots or Video\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3ceb33a-5db4-4085-b71e-60fc27cabd34\n\n### Logs\n\n<details open><summary>Logs</summary>\n\nNo relevant logs\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Flutter Doctor output\n\n<details open><summary>Doctor output</summary>\n\n```console\nkekland@Erzhans-MacBook-Pro fragment_shader_bug % flutter doctor -v\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.29.2, on macOS 15.0.1 24A348 darwin-arm64, locale en-US) [1,047ms]\n    • Flutter version 3.29.2 on channel stable at /Users/kekland/fvm/versions/3.24.3\n    • Upstream repository https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git\n    • Framework revision c236373904 (12 hours ago), 2025-03-13 16:17:06 -0400\n    • Engine revision 18b71d647a\n    • Dart version 3.7.2\n    • DevTools version 2.42.3\n\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 35.0.0-rc4) [1,331ms]\n    • Android SDK at /Users/kekland/Library/Android/sdk\n    • Platform android-35, build-tools 35.0.0-rc4\n    • ANDROID_HOME = /Users/kekland/Library/Android/sdk\n    • Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home/bin/java\n      This is the JDK bundled with the latest Android Studio installation on this machine.\n      To manually set the JDK path, use: `flutter config --jdk-dir=\"path/to/jdk\"`.\n    • Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.5+-12932927-b750.29)\n    • All Android licenses accepted.\n\n[!] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 16.0) [927ms]\n    • Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\n    • Build 16A242d\n    !

Meanwhile, the IconButton state depends on `onPressed` callback and the button color logic happens in IconButton, not in Icon widget. The fix is simply to pass `arrowHeadColor` to IconButton so that buttons will be displaying correct color when state changes.\r\n\r\n| before | after |\r\n| --------------- | --------------- |\r\n<video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20f08366-7c42-4f00-bfea-40f1c6498dd7\"/> | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a018a60f-4238-4f8a-9784-1db71592f08c\"/>\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities.\r\n- [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide], including [Features we expect every widget to implement].\r\n- [x] I signed the [CLA].\r\n- [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`).\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making, or this PR is [test-exempt].\r\n- [x] I followed the [breaking change policy] and added [Data Driven Fixes] where supported.\r\n- [x] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n\r\nIf you need help, consider asking for advice on the #hackers-new channel on [Discord].\r\n\r\n<!-- Links -->\r\n[Contributor Guide]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Tree-hygiene.md#overview\r\n[Tree Hygiene]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Tree-hygiene.md\r\n[test-exempt]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Tree-hygiene.md#tests\r\n[Flutter Style Guide]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo.md\r\n[Features we expect every widget to implement]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo.md#features-we-expect-every-widget-to-implement\r\n[CLA]: https://cla.developers.google.com/\r\n[flutter/tests]: https://github.com/flutter/tests\r\n[breaking change policy]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Tree-hygiene.md#handling-breaking-changes\r\n[Discord]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Chat.md\r\n[Data Driven Fixes]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Data-driven-Fixes.md\r\n",
